# Faster R-CNN Object Detection

## Project Overview

This project implements Faster R-CNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks) for object detection. The model is designed to detect and count objects, with a specific focus on crowd counting applications. Faster R-CNN is a two-stage object detection model where regions of interest are proposed first, followed by classification and bounding box regression.

## Key Features

- **Object Detection:** The model detects objects in an image and draws bounding boxes around them.
- **Crowd Counting:** Specially designed for detecting individuals in crowded environments, making it applicable for crowd management and security monitoring.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** The project leverages libraries like PyTorch.
- **Pretrained Models:** The model uses pretrained weights to fine-tune the object detection for specific tasks.
